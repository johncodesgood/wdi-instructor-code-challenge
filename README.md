==============

This is the Instructor Code Challenge using vanilla JavaScript and Ruby

[Code Challenge App](https://glacial-inlet-77949.herokuapp.com/)


Application Overview
--------------

This is a single page application that uses an external API to request movie data. The client side application is served by a back-end that persists data.

**Key Features:**

- The page has a form that uses the OMDB API to search for matching movies and then displays the results.

- When the user clicks on a search result detailed information about that movie is displayed.

- Users can "favorite" a movie and it is persisted via the back-end.

- Users can view a list of their favorited movies.

**Notes:**

- There is no styling on the page. The code is kept as simple as possible to focus on the key features.

- There is no error handling and limited browser support.
